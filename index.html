                Animation is an illusion of movement, composed of a sequence of still images or frames that are
                shown at a certain rate, which will make the subject appear as if it is moving. This can be
                done through several means such as using drawings, models or digital tools.

                    <h3>What is 2D Animation?</h3>
                    <p>
                        2D animation is a technique that creates movement in a two-dimensional space.
                        This involves drawing characters, objects, and backgrounds frame by frame, either traditionally
                        by hand or by digitally using softwares such as Adobe Animate.

                    <h4>Traditional Animation [Hand-drawn]</h4>
                    <p>
                        One of the oldest form of animation. A technique where each frame is drawn by hand, creating
                        the illusion of movement when these frames are played in sequence. Can be done by drawing the
                        frames individually or using cel [transparent] sheets which allows for layering.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Digital Animation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Utilizes software like Adobe Animate or Toon Boom Harmony to create and manipulate images
                        and frames, offering efficiency and versatility.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Stop Motion Animation (2D Style)</h4>
                    <p>
                        A form of Stop-Motion, this style involves photographing real-world flat objects like cut-out
                        paper, puppets, or illustrations, frame by frame, to simulate movement.

                    <p>
                        3D animation is the technique of creating moving, three-dimensional images in a digital context.
                        These visuals are made using 3D software, allowing animators to create computerized objects that
                        look 3D even though they're on a 2D surface.

                    <h3>What is Stop Motion Animation?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Stop motion animation is an advanced flipbook-style form of animation. It involves
                        photographing and then physically manipulating objects within your frame. As each frame
                        is played in sequence, the technique creates the effect of an object moving itself.

                <article class="gridarticle2">
                    <h3>How it works</h3>
                    <p>
                        Stop motion animation is created by photographing objects one frame at a time. After each photo,
                        the animator slightly moves the object before taking the next shot. When these images are played
                        back quickly in sequence, they create the illusion of smooth, continuous movement. This careful
                        frame-by-frame adjustment requires patience and precision, as even small changes can make a big
                        difference in the final animation.

                    <p>
                        Claymation is a technique using movable clay characters and stop-motion recording.
                        It's a film style often seen in children's films and cartoons. It's a meticulous process, with
                        some feature-length films taking months - or even years - to shoot.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Puppet</h4>
                    <p>
                        Puppet animation is a technique involving puppet figures that are animated
                        frame-by-frame. Usually, the animators create a physical three-dimensional scene, similar to a
                        small theatre, where the action will take place.

                        in an animated film. Is often used as a way to blend live actors with animated ones in a movie.

                    <h4>Cutout</h4>
                    <p>
                        Cutout animation is a technique using flat characters, props and backgrounds
                        cut from materials such as paper, card, stiff fabric or photographs. The props would be cut out
                        and used as puppets for stop motion.
