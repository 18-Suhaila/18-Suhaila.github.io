        Animation is an illusion of movement, composed of a sequence of still images or frames that are
        shown at a certain rate, which will make the subject appear as if it is moving. This can be
        done through several means such as using drawings, models or digital tools.

                <h3>What is 2D Animation?</h3>
                <p>
                    2D animation is a technique that creates movement in a two-dimensional space.
                    This involves drawing characters, objects, and backgrounds frame by frame, either traditionally
                    by hand or by digitally using softwares such as Adobe Animate.

                <h3>Types of 2D Animation</h3>
                <h4>Traditional Animation [Hand-drawn]</h4>
                <p>
                    One of the oldest form of animation. A technique where each frame is drawn by hand, creating
                    the illusion of movement when these frames are played in sequence. Can be done by drawing the
                    frames individually or using cel [transparent] sheets which allows for layering.
                </p>

                <h4>Digital Animation</h4>
                <p>
                    Utilizes software like Adobe Animate or Toon Boom Harmony to create and manipulate images
                    and frames, offering efficiency and versatility.
                </p>

                <h4>Stop Motion Animation (2D Style)</h4>
                <p>
                    A form of Stop-Motion, this style involves photographing real-world flat objects like cut-out
                    paper, puppets, or illustrations, frame by frame, to simulate movement.

                <h3>What is 3D Animation?</h3>
                <p>
                    3D animation is the technique of creating moving, three-dimensional images in a digital context.
                    These visuals are made using 3D software, allowing animators to create computerized objects that
                    look 3D even though they're on a 2D surface.

                <h4>Character Animation</h4>
                <p>
                    Brings digital characters to life, making them move, speak, and express emotions. It's used
                    in animated films, TV shows, and games.
                </p>

                <h4>Motion Capture (MoCap)</h4>
                <p>
                    Motion capture uses real-life actors to record movement, which is then applied to 3D models.
                    It is used for movies and video games.

                <h3>What is Motion Graphics Animation?</h3>
                <p>
                    Motion graphics animation combines graphic design and animation principles to create moving visual
                    elements. It is animated graphic design, using text, shapes, and other visual elements set in
                    motion to convey information, tell stories, or enhance a visual experience.

                    <h4>Explanation Videos</h4>
                    <p>
                        Motion graphics is used to simplify complex ideas or processes, often seen
                        in educational or product demo videos, where animated visuals help break down information,
                        which make it more engaging and easier to understand.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Advertising</h4>
                    <p>
                        They often feature bold text, product visuals, and animated elements to communicate a brand
                        message or promote a product in a dynamic and memorable way.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Social Media Content</h4>
                    <p>
                        Motion graphics enhance user experience (UX) by adding interactive or animated elements
                        like loading animations, hover effects, or transitions between sections. These subtle
                        animations guide users and make the site feel smoother and more intuitive.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Retail Experiences</h4>
                    <p>
                        Motion graphics are used in physical retail environments such as digital signage,
                        interactive kiosks, or in-store screensâ€”to draw attention, showcase products.

                <h3>What is Stop Motion Animation?</h3>
                <p>
                    Stop motion animation is an advanced flipbook-style form of animation. It involves
                    photographing and then physically manipulating objects within your frame. As each frame
                    is played in sequence, the technique creates the effect of an object moving itself. Stop
                    motion animation is a technique whose secret lies between each frame of the action.

                <h3>Types of Stop Motion Animation</h3>
                <h4>Claymation</h4>
                <p>
                    Claymation is a technique using movable clay characters and stop-motion recording.
                    It's a film style often seen in children's films and cartoons. It's a meticulous process, with
                    some feature-length films taking months - or even years - to shoot.
                </p>

                <h4>Puppet</h4>
                <p>
                    Puppet animation is a technique involving puppet figures that are animated
                    frame-by-frame. Usually, the animators create a physical three-dimensional scene, similar to a
                    small theatre, where the action will take place.
                </p>

                <h4>Pixilation</h4>
                <p>
                    Pixilation is a technique in which live actors are used as a frame-by-frame subject 
                    in an animated film. Is often used as a way to blend live actors with animated ones in a movie.
                </p>

                <h4>Cutout</h4>
                <p>
                    Cutout animation is a technique using flat characters, props and backgrounds 
                    cut from materials such as paper, card, stiff fabric or photographs. The props would be cut out 
                    and used as puppets for stop motion.
