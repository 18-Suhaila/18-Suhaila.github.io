                Animation is an illusion of movement, composed of a sequence of still images or frames that are
                shown at a certain rate, which will make the subject appear as if it is moving. This can be
                done through several means such as using drawings, models or digital tools.

                    <h3>What is 2D Animation?</h3>
                    <p>
                        2D animation is the art of creating movement in a two-dimensional space. This animation
                        technique involves characters, backgrounds, and objects that are designed and animated in flat,
                        two-dimensional environments— typically focusing on height and width, but not depth. Movements
                        are crafted frame by frame, either through traditional hand-drawing or with the help of digital
                        tools.

                    <h3>Types of 2D Animation</h3>
                    <h4>Traditional Animation [Hand-drawn]</h4>
                    <p>
                        A classic method where each frame is meticulously drawn by hand. In some workflows, animators
                        use cels (transparent sheets) to separate character and background layers, streamlining the
                        production process. Though labor-intensive, this method allows for a high level of artistic
                        expression and fluid motion.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Digital Animation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Digital tools replicate the frame-by-frame process using drawing tablets and software. It allows
                        for faster production, easier editing, and reuse of assets (like rigs, backgrounds, or symbols).
                        It blends traditional techniques with the convenience of modern technology.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Stop Motion Animation (2D Style)</h4>
                    <p>
                        A method where real-world, flat materials like cut-out paper, drawings, or puppets are
                        physically moved and photographed one frame at a time. This creates a 2D animated effect with a
                        tangible, handmade feel. Think of it as a hybrid of puppetry and animation—films.

                    <h3>What is 3D Animation?</h3>
                    <p>
                        3D animation is the technique of creating moving, three-dimensional images in a digital context.
                        These visuals are made using 3D software, allowing animators to create computerized objects that
                        look 3D even though they're on a 2D surface.

                    <h3>Types of 3D Animation</h3>
                    <h4>Character Animation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Gives life to digital characters. Through techniques like rigging (creating a skeleton for the
                        character) and keyframing (defining movement at specific frames), characters do a lot of things
                        and display a range of emotions. Character animation is the cornerstone of animated films, TV
                        shows, and video games where storytelling and emotional engagement are critical.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Motion Capture (MoCap)</h4>
                    <p>
                        Motion capture technology records the movements of real-life actors using sensors or cameras.
                        They are then mapped onto 3D digital models, allowing for realistic animation of characters.
                        MoCap is widely used in films and in AAA video games to create fluid and natural movements.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Mechanical and Object Animation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Besides characters, 3D animation is used to animate machines, vehicles, or any non-living
                        objects. This is common in product visualizations, commercials, and technical demonstrations,
                        where showing the function or design of an object is essential.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Visual Effects (VFX)</h4>
                    <p>
                        3D animation plays a major role in creating stunning visual effects like explosions, smoke,
                        water, and magical phenomena. These effects are integrated with live-action footage to enhance
                        storytelling and realism.

                    <h3>What is Stop Motion Animation?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Stop motion animation is a technique that brings static physical objects to life by
                        photographing them one frame at a time. As each frame is played back in rapid succession, the
                        illusion of motion is created—much like an advanced, real-world flipbook. Stop motion relies on
                        tangible materials like clay, puppets, paper, or even people. This hands-on approach gives stop
                        motion a distinct charm, often characterized by slightly jerky, handmade motion.
                    </p>
                </article>

                <article class="gridarticle2">
                    <h3>How it works</h3>
                    <p>
                        Stop motion animation is made by capturing individual frames of objects or characters that are
                        physically adjusted in tiny increments between each photo. Each adjustment represents a single
                        frame of animation. When these frames are compiled and played at a standard frame rate (12 to
                        24fps), the movement appears fluid to the human eye.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>Key steps include:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Planning</b>: Storyboarding and designing characters/sets.</li>
                        <li><b>Set Building</b>: Creating a physical environment where the animation takes place.</li>
                        <li><b>Animation</b>: Moving the objects slightly, frame by frame, and taking a photo at each
                            step.</li>
                        <li><b>Post-Production</b>: Editing the footage, adding sound, visual effects, or digital
                            enhancements.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Types of Stop Motion Animation</h3>
                    <h4>Claymation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Claymation is a form of stop motion where characters and scenes are made out of malleable clay
                        or plasticine. Animators sculpt and reshape the figures between frames, creating expressive and
                        organic movement. Due to the flexible nature of clay, characters can show exaggerated emotions
                        or transform shapes easily— though it requires great care to avoid smudging or unintended
                        distortions.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Puppet</h4>
                    <p>
                        Puppet animation involves articulated puppets, often with wire armatures or joints, posed in a
                        miniature physical set. Each frame is captured as the puppet is slightly moved to simulate
                        motion. This type of animation is often used for fantasy films or children's stories due to its
                        theatrical, lifelike quality.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Pixilation</h4>
                    <p>
                        Pixilation stop motion technique where real human actors are used as frame-by-frame subjects.
                        The actors pose repeatedly for each frame, giving the illusion that people are moving in
                        unnatural, animated ways. This surreal effect has been used in both experimental films and music
                        videos. It's a playful and visually striking approach that blurs the line between live-action
                        and animation.
                    </p>

                    <h4>Cutout</h4>
                    <p>
                        Cutout animation uses flat characters, props, and environments—often made from paper, card, or
                        photographs—manipulated frame-by-frame on a flat surface or lightbox. This method was used in
                        early animation and is notable for its stylistic simplicity.
